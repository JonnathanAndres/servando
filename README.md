Servando is an open and distributed telemedicine platform based on Android, developed by the intelligent systems unit in the Centro de Investigación en Tecnoloxías da Información (CITIUS) of the University of Santiago de Compostela.
Servando deals with a number of recurrent problems in telemedicine systems, such as:
- The scheduling of the different medical actions that should be executed, organized in a personalized agenda generated from a follow-up protocol.
- Functionality encapsulation and reuse in a set of services.
- Communications between the patient home and the hospital, through a flexible scheme for bidirectional message exchange.
- The management of the events and alerts generated during the monitoring.

Servando allows the development of generic telemedicine applications, adaptable according to the disease or the particular characteristics of the patient.
